# TripSplit Project Plan

## Phase 1: Initial Setup

### Iteration 1: Project Setup

#### Backend:
- Set up the Rust project using cargo with proper structure.
- Choose beetwen storing data in Databases/Blockchain contract

#### Frontend:
- Initialize a JavaScript framework (e.g., React, Next.js, or Vue.js).
- Create a basic UI skeleton with placeholders for core functionalities like adding trips, viewing expenses, etc.

### Iteration 2: Basic Backend Functionality

- Develop Rust functions to interact with the blockchain for adding expenses, retrieving trip details, and managing participants.
- Implement APIs for the frontend to consume, such as endpoints for creating trips, adding expenses, and viewing the balance.

#### Frontend:
- Create basic forms in the UI to collect trip and expense data.
- Use JavaScript to call backend APIs and display results.

### Iteration 3: Frontend upgrade

#### Frontend:
- Update the frontend to interact with the blockchain-based database using the backend API.
- Display confirmations for transactions stored on the blockchain (e.g., expense added confirmation).

## Phase 2: Advanced Features

### Iteration 4: User Authentication & Management

#### Backend:
- Implement user authentication
- Create logic for associating users with trips and keeping track of their expenses.
